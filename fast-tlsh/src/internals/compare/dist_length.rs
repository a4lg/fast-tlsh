//! TLSH length comparison.
//!
//! This depends on the difference of encoded 8-bit length specifier.
//! If their [distance (on the ring of modulo 256)](crate::internals::compare::utils::distance_on_ring_mod())
//! is equal to or less than `1`, that value is the distance.  If not, the raw
//! distance `d` is multiplied by the implementation-defined constant:
//! [`12`](length_mult_value!()).
//!
//! Unlike the official implementation, this constant is not designed to be
//! easily configurable in this crate but we usually use this parameter unless
//! you are experimenting with your custom workloads.
